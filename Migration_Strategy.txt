Migration Strategy
The strategy combines lift-and-shift for databases and refactoring for applications. 
We'll use AWS DMS for database migration, Terraform for infrastructure setup, and GitHub Actions for application deployment.

Migration Roadmap
The migration will be executed in phases.  
	Phase 1: Planning
    * Activities: Inventory on-premises resources, assess dependencies, and map to AWS services. 
	              Perform a security audit and define requirements for refactoring.  
    * Key Deliverables: Migration plan document, Terraform templates for initial VPC setup, and GitHub repository setup.  
    * Tools: Use AWS Application Discovery Service for inventory.  
	Phase 2: Infrastructure Setup 
    * Provision AWS resources using Terraform:
         Create VPC, subnets, security groups, and NACLs.
         Set up RDS instances for Oracle and MS SQL.
         Deploy EKS cluster for Docker orchestration.
         Configure EC2 instances for Windows web apps.
    * Integrate CI/CD: Set up GitHub Actions workflows for application builds.
    * Security: Enable encryption, IAM roles, and initial monitoring with CloudWatch.
    * Milestones: Fully provisioned environment, test connectivity between components.
	Phase 3: Database Migration (Lift and Shift) 
    * Activities: Lift and shift databases using AWS DMS (replicate Oracle to EC2 and MSSQL to RDS). 
				  Refactor and deploy applications: migrate Windows apps to EC2 VMs and Docker images to EKS.
				  Use GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
    * Key Deliverables: Successful data migration with validation. Applications running in a staging environment.
    * Milestones: Conduct end-to-end testing, including load testing on EKS. Monitor for any security vulnerabilities.
	Phase 4: Application Refactoring and Migration 
    * Activities: Perform user acceptance testing. Enable monitoring and incident response tools. Cut over from on-premises to AWS.
    * Key Deliverables: Fully operational architecture with automated backups and alerts. 
						Decommission on-premises resources post-verification.
    * Milestones: Achieve zero-downtime migration and confirm SLA compliance.
	Phase 5: Optimization and Handover
    * Monitor with CloudWatch and optimize resources (auto-scaling for EKS).
    * Incident response: Set up alerts and response.
    * Milestones: Once full migration complete, hand over to operations team.
